    ParaDiS is an open-source software, developed by LLNL. I made
    some improvements using Intel AVX intrinsic functions. Make sure
    your CPU support Intel AVX instruction sets (Intel Sandy Bridge or
    later). 
    
    For general information on compiling, configuring, and running
    ParaDiS simulations, refer to the ParaDiS User's Guide for the
    current version located at

        docs/ParaDiSUsersGuide-VX.X.X.pdf
